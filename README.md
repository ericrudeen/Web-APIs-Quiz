# Web-APIs-Quiz

This week we were given the task of developing a quiz on Javascript fundamentals. There was not any starter code so we needed to code out the html, css, and js from scratch. 

Here is the acceptance criteria:

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score

I could have spent at least 20 more hours on this assignment, I just didn't have the time in my schedule this week. I expect this submission will receive a low score because of the missing functionalities but I still learned quite a lot over the duration of this project.
